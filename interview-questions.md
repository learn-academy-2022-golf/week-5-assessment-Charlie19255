# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does calling super do in a class?

Your answer: Calling super in a class means that the class is a child of another class. The child class is able to inherit methods and characteristics of the parent class. The super allows for creating an object in the child class and passing arguments to the parent class to attain the methods and characteristics as described before. This allows for more universal ability of the parent class allowing for more child classes to be more distinct while reusing past code.

Researched answer: It is used to pass arguments implicitly to the parent class. It is used to access the method of the parent class while maintaining the individuality of a child class. Utilizing just the super key word without any paretheses will result in an argument error. If no arguments are required for the parent class, then the super keyword must be called with an empty parentheses to pass properly.

2. What is a gem?

Your answer: A gem is a package used to install Rspec. This is necessary since Rspec is used to test Ruby code. Without the gem installer, Ruby code would not be able to be trial run without going through actual coding. This is a result of test driven development which is efficient in making code that corresponds with what the developer wants to achieve.

Researched answer: A gem is a file containing a lib directory, test directory, rakefile, bin, documentation, and a gemspec. It has a version, and tests that are utilized for the framework the developer uses. The gem is used to allow the developer to use the code within without directly inserting the code. This is because gems can be installed off the internet allowing developers to use as neccessary to test different frameworks.

3. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: A relational database is a bank of information that is able to correlate inputs and retrieve the appropriate information. There are many different kinds of databases that correspond with different API's which have many uses to their information. For an example, NASA has an open source API for the public to use which has data contained about the stars and planets other than our own.

Researched answer: A relational database is a set of tables containing columns and rows. The tables are used to house the data that is matched up with pre-defined relationships. Some other types of databases are centralized, cloud, commercial, personal, open-source, end-user, graph, NoSQL, object-oriented, operational, and distributed. Each has their own purpose, such as centralized is in one location usually for universities or companies located in a central computer containing the database.

4. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: Primary keys are a notation device. It is used to indicate that it belongs to one string of information. This is so that strings of information that have the same name do not correspond with each other mixing up the data and making it hard to read. Primary keys allow us to differentiate between data even if the information is exactly the same.

Researched answer: They are unique identifiers for each table record. They can be used to quickly look through a table for a piece of data. Only one primary key is assigned to one table. They are important to relational databases as a table may contain many records in which duplicates occur. It is imperative that the primary key is utilized to differentiate the two duplicates from each other.

5. What are the HTTP verbs? What is each verb's corresponding CRUD action?

Your answer: The HTTP verbs are put, post, delete, patch, and pull. Put and patch correspond with the update action allowing to change data as required. The create is associated with the post action, allowing users to make a new data appear. The pull is the read action pair meaning that users can ascertain information to take in. The delete action and the delete are the same to get rid of unneccessary information.

Researched answer: The HTTP verbs are get, head, post, put, delete, connect, options, trace, and patch. They are request methods used to define what actions are to be performed. They each correspond to one of the four CRUD actions. Create is related to post, connect, and trace. Read is related to get, head, and options. Update is related to put and patch. Delete is related to delete.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: standards used in different languages for time-efficient and reusable pathways

2. Ruby on Rails: Fullstack framework used to build apps on front end and back end.

3. Database migrations: process of transfering data from one or more databases to one or more chosen databases using a service.

4. Params: A keyword where no other additional parameters are allowed. Shorthand for method parameter.

5. ERB: returns string in the same code as the input string. It is useful for generic templating situations.
